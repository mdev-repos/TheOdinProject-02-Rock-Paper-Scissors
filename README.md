# The Odin Project - Rock Paper Scissors Project (2)

This is the second project required in The Odin Project Foundations Course.
In this case, the request was to build a classic rock, paper, scissors game on a console, which would take the user's income and generate (randomly) a computer choice to be played up to 5 rounds.
I took the liberty of building a GUI to make the game a little more attractive. I hope you enjoy my result :)
